# Identifying Circuit behind Pronoun Prediction in GPT-2 Small

In this work, I tried making progress towards identifying the circuit for choosing the right pronouns (e.g. he vs she vs it vs they) to complete a rhetorical question (so it doesn’t spoil the answer!) like “{name} is a great friend, isn’t” implemented by GPT-2 Small, a 12 layer and 80M parameter transformer model.

Here is the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWOenqSMl1-zlotj_GYXXu37JgM2McHf-sxAzpIBJkM/edit?usp=sharing) summarizing the results.
